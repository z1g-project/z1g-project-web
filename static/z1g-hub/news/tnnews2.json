NOTE THAT WHEN YOUR DISCORD IS LINKED, WHATEVER USERNAME YOU SET IN EAGLER OR WHATEVER CLIENT YOU USE IS THE USERNAME THAT YOU USE ON THE SERVER. we use AuthMeReloaded. be sure to remember your password that you set after you link your discord. do not annoy staff for resets. Economy coming soon (or never) staff applications are not open don't make a ticket for them JAVA URLs: mc.aubruh.com smartphowned.lol EAGLER URLs: wss://mc.aubruh.com version: 1.8.8-1.8.9 (we have grim and trying to use other versions will result in tripping the ac and eventually getting banned after sending many errors) for boosters, supporters, and tnvpn members, there are some funny kits up for grab depending on the role. there are also some funny ranks depending on the role.",
